GBT python work
---------------

We are faced with 3 existing packages: GBTIDL, gbt-pipeline and
gbtgridder. Only the first one is not in python, and will need to be
integrated. 


Nomenclature of SD observations:
   region      - over many days and possibly RA/DEC
   session     - same 'day' continguous in time
   block       - observation unit
   scan        - integrations that belong together (few mins)
   integration - integrtion of a specific state (pointing, band, polarizations, ...)

(where does OTF come in here?)



GBTIDL can be 'converted' to python in several ways (details in gbtoy.txt)

1)  keep the function names and functionality the same as much as possible,
    but use pyspeckit under the hood

2)  same as 1), but literally  translating IDL -> python. A lot more work.

3)  using pyspeckit natively

4)  bringing the sdfits interfaces that gbt-pipeline uses into the loop.
    probably not useful to 1) , but could be useful for 2)

Either way, the peculiar graphics display that GBTIDL is using should
be investigated if pure matplotlib has this functionality, or do we
need an embedded wxPython ot QtPython interface around it (or another
GUI wrapper).

Other Software

UniPOPS:    the pre-historic program on which everything seems to be based    https://www.cv.nrao.edu/unipops/

DISH:  (AIPS++ and glish):  https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/GB/Data/DishUsersGuideForGBT
       Note that GBTIDL derived all the functionality from DISH, which in itself was derived from UniPOPS
       scan  - integrations 

CASA:  there is an SD package, which originated with the Nobeyama 45m
