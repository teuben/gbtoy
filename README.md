# gbtoy
toying with gbt spectra in python


## notes

* gbtidl does not work with gdl, it really needs IDL

* Lots of info on http://gbtidl.nrao.edu/

* Example data  and commands for gbtidl on http://www.gb.nrao.edu/GBT/DA/gbtidl/users_guide/node72.html

* The [sdfits](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/sdfits.html) convention webpage has an example TREG_091209.cal.acs.fits SDFITS file that appears to have correct headers, the other one, PParkes_GASS.fits , has something missing

* https://github.com/pyspeckit     pyspeckit  (has routines to read GBT/SDFITS data; Adam Ginsburg))

* https://github.com/GreenBankObservatory   gbt-pipeline and gbtgridder

* https://github.com/GBTSpectroscopy  gbtpipe (Erik Rosolowsky)
