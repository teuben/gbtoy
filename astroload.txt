On UMD's 'astronet' computers you can:

      astroload gbt

and you will get some tools for our GBT project.


- gbtidl (yet the real IDL version)

- a new python where we stuff packages we experiment with (e.g. pyspeckit)

- the sdinspect (and possibly more), which uses pyspeckit to "look" at an SDFITS file.
  It can fail!
  My favorite galaxy is NGC2347.fits, it's already in the so-called IDL "keep" format,
  meaning it's been calibrated.


Some data and pdf's relevant to the project are in /chara/teuben/GBT,
perhaps I could move that into /astromake/opt/gbt somewhere.


Here's a small exercize, taken from Example 1 in the Users' Guide:

in GBTIDL:

filein, 'ngc5291.fits' 
summary
for i=51,57,2 do begin getps, i, plnum=0 & accum & end  
for i=51,57,2 do begin getps, i, plnum=1 & accum & end  
ave
chan  
nregion,[3300,14800,17900,31000]  
nfit,3  
sety, 0.2, 0.5  
bshape  
baseline  
unzoom
hanning,/decimate  
bdrop, 2500 
edrop, 2500 
velo 
stats, 2000, 3000  
stats, 3900, 4800  
boxcar, 8
fileout, 'ngc5291-saved.fits'
keep

in SHELL:

sdinspect ngc5291-saved.fits


in GBTIDL with the "keep" file:

filein,'NGC2347.fits'
getrec,0
chan
nregion,[6000,7500,8700,10200]    ; must be in channels
nfit,6
sety, 0.1, 0.2

sety, -0.1, 0.2
velo
setx, 3500, 5000
hanning,/decimate  
boxcar, 8
annotate, 3800, 0.1, 'This is NGC 2347 from the EDGE survey', color=!blue, charsize=2.0
